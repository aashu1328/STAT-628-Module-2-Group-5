# Body Fat Study

This is a project that we are working on to predict the body fat% based on different features.

There are three folders named as "Code", "Data" and "Image". 

The Code folder contains all code for data analysis, visualization and Shiny App. 

Inside the Data Work folder:
The raw data is found under the name of "BodyFat". It has 252 rows and 17 features.
The cleaned data is found under the name of "BodyFat_Clean". It has 249 rows and 17 features.

The Code folder contains all Images in the Code.

The final model that we came up with was : Body Fat% = 0.78 + 0.60*Abdomen(cm)-0.21*Height(cm)
