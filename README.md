This is a project that we are wokring on to predict the body fat% based on different features.

There are two folders named as " Rough Work" and " Final Work". The Final Work folder has all the final code files and output files.

The cleaned data is found under the name of "BodyFat_Clean". It has 249 rows and 17 features.
The code for the project is found under the name " Final Code".
There are other model diagnosis and correlation images are present as well.
